				<h1>Dogs</h1>
				<p>
					The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices as
					there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog
					offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of
					having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog.
					Studies even show medical indicators such as
					<a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554" target="_blank"
						>reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles</a
					>. If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful
					of what you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In this page, you
					will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various stages of
					their lives.

			<section id="diet-and-exercise">
				<h1>Diet&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Excercise</h1>
				<p>
					Diet & Exercise Throughout dogs`'lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as
					they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals
					per day when they are about three to six months years old. Their food intake should be
					reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced
					to one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog's typical body mass is composed of
					somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The
					<a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips" target="_blank"
						>ASPCA</a
					>
					says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can
					cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs
					healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies
					greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a range of 30-120 minutes of
					exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I know
					that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe!
					And by the way, exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up
					contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage
					physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard.
					Pay careful attention to toys that require supervision.
				</p>

			<section id="grooming-and-handling">
				<h1>Grooming&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Handling</h1>
				<p>
					Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush
					frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can
					prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
					especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your dog's
					health but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse
					<b>all</b> of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is
					formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. And as
					always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need
					to be cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with
					one hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog,
					reach under the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to
					support the chest and rear as you lift.

			<section id="vaccinations-and-medications">
				<h1>Vaccinations&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Medications</h1>
				<p>
					You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that
					are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as
					hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the
					environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include

						>Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria</a
