				<h1>Cats</h1>
				<p>
					Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently
					the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique
					documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and
					practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member
					regardless of breed.

				<h1>Zero to Four Weeks</h1>
				<p>
					Zero to Four Weeks It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is
					either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kittenâ€™s
					growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not
					growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either
					with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight
					appropriately include the following:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mt-3 ps-10">
					<li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
					<li>gastrointestinal disease</li>
					<li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section id="cats-four-weeks-to-one-year">
				<h1>Four Weeks to One Year</h1>
				<p>
					Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four
					weeks after birth. According to the
					<a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips" target="_blank"
						>ASPCA</a
					>, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces
					of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small
					amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens
					provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness.
					Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always
					consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="cats-one-year-to-seven-years">
				<h1>One Year to Seven Years</h1>
				<p>
					This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this
					age, their level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is
					<b>not</b> recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a
					couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice
					reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="cats-seven-years-and-more">
				<h1>Seven Years and More</h1>
				<p>
					Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of
					changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This
					means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a
					particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as fish). This usually
					means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
